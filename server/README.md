blog to podcast workflow:

1. Given a blog post(s) (url or text), extract the following:
   - title
   - author
   - date

2. User decides how many podcastors involved, their names, tones, styles, and
   characteristics. User then decides the podcast format, e.g. interview,
   monologue, etc. We do prompt engineering to generate the scripts.
3. User then modifies the scripts if needed by giving feedbacks directly or by
   editing the specific parts.

   tone.
