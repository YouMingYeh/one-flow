**Intro**

**Alex:** Welcome to today's episode of "Mind Matters," where we dive deep into the issues that touch our hearts and minds. I'm Alex.

**Jamie:** And I'm Jamie. Today we'll be exploring a topic that's both deeply personal and universally relevant: self-isolation as a coping mechanism. We'll be sharing insights from a thought-provoking blog by R titled "To Those Who Disappear When Things Get Tough."

**Dialogue**

1. **Alex:** Jamie, have you ever felt the urge to just disappear when things get tough?

2. **Jamie:** Oh, absolutely. It's almost like my default reaction when I'm overwhelmed. 

3. **Alex:** R starts the blog with a powerful admission. "I never liked being alone, but for some reason I’m always on my own; not because I’m a loner myself, but because I choose to self-isolate when everything just feels like a lot to handle."

4. **Jamie:** That's something I can relate to so much. R continues, "Coming from a person whose love language includes quality time, I find it difficult to ignore the urge to just disappear after every minor inconvenience in my life."

5. **Alex:** It's interesting how R's need for quality time conflicts with the instinct to isolate. They crave love and attention, yet distance themselves when they're struggling.

6. **Jamie:** Yes, and that paradox is so human. R mentions, "Most of the time, people who are a great listener are also the ones who don’t have anyone to turn to when life’s being a bummer to them."

7. **Alex:** They tend to be there for everyone else but are always absent when it comes to their own needs. It’s such a powerful observation.

8. **Jamie:** And it makes us question, why do we push people away when we need them the most?

9. **Alex:** R writes, "These kinds of people are the most dangerous as they’re very good at pretending; pretending to be fine, pretending to have things under control, when in reality, they’re struggling to even get out of bed."

10. **Jamie:** That struck a chord with me. The facade of being okay can be so exhausting.

11. **Alex:** R is still learning not to vanish, but admits it’s not an easy process. "I still have the desire to be alone when I’m upset. But oh it must be nice to be heard, without having to say a word."

12. **Jamie:** That’s such a pure desire. To be understood without the need to explain yourself.

13. **Alex:** But as R points out, "People are not mind readers, they can’t scan our thoughts and find out what has been bothering us."

14. **Jamie:** Exactly. Communication is crucial, but R wisely highlights that "communication AND comprehension are both essential towards understanding."

15. **Alex:** They go hand in hand. If we don't tell others what's bothering us, we can’t expect them to understand.

16. **Jamie:** True, but being the understanding one is just as important as being understood.

17. **Alex:** We should reconsider expecting people to read our minds and learn to express ourselves better.

18. **Jamie:** R puts it beautifully, "From time to time, all we want is to be heard and understood, so consider yourself lucky if you have someone that chooses to stay, even if you walk away."

19. **Alex:** Let yourself be heard this time, instead of constantly being the listener.

20. **Jamie:** Life’s a pain in the butt, but we don’t always have to go through it alone. If we don’t have someone, sometimes all we have is ourselves and God.

21. **Alex:** R concludes with a powerful message, "So to the people who disappear as their coping mechanism, give yourself a chance to be understood."

22. **Jamie:** Be nice to yourself, speak kind words to yourself, forgive yourself, as you would to others.

23. **Alex:** Give yourself the love you freely give to others. Your needs are priorities as well.

24. **Jamie:** Isn’t it fascinating how R's insights resonate with so many of us? This blog is a heartfelt reminder to break the cycle of self-isolation.

25. **Alex:** Absolutely. So Jamie, how do we start applying these insights to our own lives?

26. **Jamie:** I think it starts with small steps. Opening up even when it feels uncomfortable, talking to friends or a therapist, and practicing self-compassion.

27. **Alex:** It’s definitely a journey. One thing I’ve found helpful is journaling. Writing down my thoughts when talking feels too hard.

28. **Jamie:** That’s a great idea. Another thing is mindfulness and meditation, helping us stay grounded and aware of our emotions.

29. **Alex:** And let’s not forget checking in with our friends who seem strong on the outside. They might be the ones needing someone to listen.

30. **Jamie:** Exactly. Sometimes a simple “How are you, really?” can make a world of difference.

31. **Alex:** This conversation reminds me that while it’s okay to need solitude, balance is key. Isolation should not be the only coping mechanism.

32. **Jamie:** Right. Balance is essential. It’s a blend of giving ourselves space while also reaching out for support.

33. **Alex:** Do you remember any time when reaching out helped you more than isolating?

34. **Jamie:** Definitely. There were moments when just a short conversation with a friend shifted my perspective entirely.

35. **Alex:** It’s amazing how human connection can be so healing. 

36. **Jamie:** Absolutely. So, to all our listeners, if you’re resonating with R’s blog, know that you’re not alone. 

37. **Alex:** Right. Take small steps towards opening up, even if it feels uncomfortable. Vulnerability isn’t weakness; it’s a strength.

38. **Jamie:** And remember, your needs are just as important as anyone else’s. Self-care isn’t selfish; it’s necessary.

39. **Alex:** Let’s end this episode with a challenge. Reach out to one person today and share something that’s been on your mind. 

40. **Jamie:** Yes, let’s try that. And if you’re on the receiving end, listen with compassion and understanding.

41. **Alex:** We’d love to hear your thoughts on this episode. Share your experiences with us on social media or through our email. 

42. **Jamie:** Special thanks to R for their inspiring blog. It’s given us a lot to ponder and discuss.

43. **Alex:** And thank you to our listeners for tuning in. Remember, you don’t have to go through tough times alone.

44. **Jamie:** We’re here for you. Until next time, take care of yourselves and each other.
